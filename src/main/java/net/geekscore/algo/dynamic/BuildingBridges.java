 *  Consider a 2-D map with a horizontal river passing through its center.
 *  There are n cities on the southern bank with x-coordinates a(1) ... a(n) and n cities on the northern bank
 *  with x-coordinates b(1) ... b(n).
 *  You want to connect as many north-south pairs of cities as possible with bridges such that no two bridges cross.
 *  When connecting cities, you can only connect city i on the northern bank to city i on the southern bank.
